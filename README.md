## Welcome and hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a sysadmin, developer and manager, who used to be a business owner in the before times. I co-founded tummy.com, a Linux Sysadmin consulting company and dedicated managed hosting company, and ran it for 26 years. I had the privilege of working with an exceptional team, and great customers and vendors.

I'm currently working on machine learning, with a special focus on time series and sequential data, with applications to computer operations.

My learning is around PyTorch, CUDA, and all varieties of machine learning. I read more than one paper just about every day.

I'm looking to consult in the area of Linux operations, including optimizing developer pipelines.

I'm looking for help with gathering sample data for use in training models on log files from containers, virtual machines and bare metal. 

Looking to help with mentoring around git, devops, github actions, system architecture...

You can reach me by opening an issue on this repository.

Colorado, US.
