## Welcome and hello ðŸ‘‹

Hi. I'm Evelyn. Open Source has been my career for a long time, as a developer, sysadmin and business owner. I co-founded tummy.com, a Linux Sysadmin consulting company and dedicated managed hosting company, and ran it for 26 years. I had the privilege of working with an exceptional team, and great customers and vendors. We were early adopters of Python, and I've been a Python developer since 1998. We never got to be a large company, but I am very proud that we grew the careers of many people, and helped many companies grow and succeed.

After closing tummy.com, I was a manager of an OpenShift support team at Red Hat, where I saw behind the curtains of much of the worlds largest companies. I'm grateful for the experience, and the people I worked with, and especially for the opportunity to see how every organization is distinct in its culture and practices around technology. I am more proud than ever of the tummy.com team, and the work we did, after seeing the variety of ways that technology teams work.

For the last couple of years my focus has been on keeping up with the leading edge of machine learning. It's the most exciting time in technology I've seen in my career.

I know how powerful the models are, when skillfully used, and even then, I don't use them enough.
